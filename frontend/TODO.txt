* Now I have to make a protected route which ask the master password again on every refresh and without giving the password the user should not enter the UI.

* Now to encrypt and decrypt Vault secrets, I need to save the decryptedVaultKey after sign-up and sign-in  in the redux global user-state. So that I can use the decryptedVaultKey to encrypt and decrypt Vault secrets. For this I have to use - AES-GCM.
