* now have to fix the 2fa and password CRUD operations.

* The MasterPasswordGuard and ProtectedRoute should only wrap the Vault only.

* Now to encrypt and decrypt Vault secrets, I need to save the decryptedVaultKey after sign-up and sign-in  in the redux global user-state. So that I can use the decryptedVaultKey to encrypt and decrypt Vault secrets. For this I have to use - AES-GCM.
