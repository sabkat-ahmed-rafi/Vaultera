* Now i have to make the protected route 
* And have to design the other route inside the vault then the functionaltiy 
* Then the subscription and onetime plan

* The MasterPasswordGuard and ProtectedRoute should only wrap the Vault only.

* Now to encrypt and decrypt Vault secrets, I need to save the decryptedVaultKey after sign-up and sign-in  in the redux global user-state. So that I can use the decryptedVaultKey to encrypt and decrypt Vault secrets. For this I have to use - AES-GCM.
